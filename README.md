<h1>Summary</h1>

The reuirement sof this project was to make one of three mobile applications presented to us and I chose the Inventory App. This mobile application is for anyone who needs to keep a count of large or small quantity items. This app will allow for users to create an account, login, perform CRUD operations for items that they wish to keep track of, and enable SMS notifications so they can be notified when an item quantity gets low. The app shows the user's item in a grid view fpr ease of veiwing to promote a desirable UI/UX.

<h1>Screens and Features</h1>

Necessary screens and feature of this mobile app include the login/ register screen so a user only sees their specific items, the SMS notification page, and the item list view page.  There is a subpage for the item list page that allows users to use PUT and Delete methods for a specific item they clicked on. I wanted the UI to be as clean as possible so I put myself in the shows of the app's potential users when developing the design for this app which is why I think my finsihed app was successful in regards to the UI. 

<h1>Approach to Coding</h1>

When devloping this app, I started with the screen layouts in Android Studio, giving every view or button a specific ID. There is four (4) different activies for the the necessary screens in this app and each activity and their contents are names conventionally and properly linked to the ID that will control each view or button through the Strings resource. The Java code was written to be resuable and maintable; each method has a specific and sole purpose so future updates will be easy to identify where it should go and reflect the same format. This project use XML, Java and SQL. 

<h1>Testing</h1>

Testing for this mobile app was done manually through trial and error through the emulator. After each new component was added I tested to make sure everything worked together and nothing broke as well as the newly developed component such as logining in and/or registering an account as well as editing items and adding items was working properly. 

<h1>Overview of Whish Knowledge, Skills, and/or Experience Were Displayed</h1>

I feel like this project overall is a good representation on my skills, knowledge, and experience. My educational and professional experience has lead me to be able to write clean, maintainable, and resuable code which has become a skill of mine. This specific project shows how my knowledge can grow over the span of a short period of time and adapt and become succesful in developing new products in which I have no experience developing.
